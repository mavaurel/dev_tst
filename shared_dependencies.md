1. "lazyloadLibrary.js": This file will contain the main logic for the lazy loading library. Shared dependencies might include utility functions from "utils.js", and specific lazy loading functions from "lazyloadImage.js", "lazyloadBackground.js", "lazyloadIframe.js", and "lazyloadVideo.js".

2. "utils.js": This file will contain utility functions that are used across the library. These might include functions for checking if an element is in the viewport, attaching event listeners, and handling data attributes.

3. "lazyloadImage.js", "lazyloadBackground.js", "lazyloadIframe.js", "lazyloadVideo.js": These files will contain the specific logic for lazy loading images, backgrounds, iframes, and videos respectively. They will likely share some utility functions from "utils.js", and will be used by "lazyloadLibrary.js".

4. "index.js": This file will be the entry point for the library, and will import and use the main lazy loading function from "lazyloadLibrary.js".

5. Test files: These files will contain tests for the corresponding source files. They will share the same function and variable names as the source files, and will also use some utility functions for testing.

6. "webpack.config.js": This file will contain the configuration for Webpack, which will be used to bundle the library. It will reference the entry point file ("index.js") and output file.

7. "package.json": This file will contain metadata about the library and its dependencies. It will reference all the source files and test files.

8. ".babelrc": This file will contain the configuration for Babel, which will be used to transpile the library to vanilla JavaScript. It will reference the source files.

9. ".gitignore": This file will specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git. It will likely include the "node_modules" directory and any build or output files.

Shared variables and function names might include "lazyLoad", "isInViewport", "attachListener", "handleDataAttr", and "init". Shared data schemas might include the options for the lazy loading function, and the data attributes for the lazy loaded elements. Shared id names might include the ids of the elements to be lazy loaded. Shared message names might include error messages for when lazy loading fails.
